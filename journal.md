* Done: 
    * Played a bit with the makemore_part2 MLP hyperparameters (context size, batch size,hidden layer size)
    * Watch the start of the build makemore part3 video
* To do:
    * Deeply read the micrograd notebook and takes notes
    * Restart watching the build makemore part3 video, but before that, create a notebook similar to makemore_part3 video does

----------------------------------------------------
* 2025-02-25 *
* Done:
    * Finished the makemore part5 video
* To do:
    * Start versioning this repo
    * Decide what do next:
      * Watch the next Karparthy's video about GPT?
      * Start a project to test what I've learned so far?
      * Try to implement the convolutional layer mentioned in the makemore part5 video?
      * Try to implement the GRU layer mentioned in the makemore part5 video?
      * Apply what I've learned to my_mnist.ipynb notebook
      * See DeepSeek R1 from scratch series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWNxQIq0hMo
      * Perhaps I should create something to manage what to do next
* Obs:
    * Nice blogs:

* Doing:
    * Started the makemore part6 video, which consists of applying a convolutional layer to the makemore dataset.
* To do:
    * Finish the makemore part6 video
